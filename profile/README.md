##We're Chef!  ðŸ‘‹

Our users use [Chef Infra](https://github.com/chef/chef/) to manage configurations, deployments, and software across a multitude of end points. They use [Chef Habitat](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat) to build and deploy applications without regard for the underlying infrastructure. They use [Chef InSpec](https://github.com/inspec/inspec) to ensure security and compliance along every step of the process. 

If you're new, [this set of videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMijB1JIuU&list=PL11cZfNdwNyNYcpntVe6js-prb80LBZuc) are a great place to start learning, then get your feet wet with our self-paced learning platform [Learn Chef](https://learn.chef.io). We've also got some brilliant [documentation](https://docs.chef.io/). Our amazing team hosts tons and tons of [webinars](https://www.chef.io/webinars) and [livestreams](https://www.twitch.tv/chefsoftware) to help you learn about new things that we're doing. We track bug reports right here on github, and all feature requests go on our [Chef Ideas](https://chef-software.ideas.aha.io/) site.

Once you're ready to start hanging out with other Chef users (especially if you hit any snags), [community.chef.io](https://community.chef.io/) is your hub for [all the things](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/all-the-things)!
